# HTML5 Bookmarks
### Knockout.js and html5 bookmark tool

Live demo [here] (http://esri.github.com/100-lines-or-less-js/mapbook/index.html)

This app uses the [knockout.js] (http://knockoutjs.com/) framework along with the compact version of ESRI's [ArcGIS API for JavaScript](http://help.arcgis.com/en/webapi/javascript/arcgis/index.html) to create a modern bookmarking tool. Bookmarks are stored using [HTML5 Web Storage] (http://www.html5rocks.com/en/features/storage) to maintain them across sessions. The app also implements the [History API] (http://slides.html5rocks.com/#history-api) to allow users to move through bookmarks using the forward and back buttons.
